## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

Given the large scope, I'll implement:
1. Critical controllers first (Document Management, Compliance)
2. Basic CRUD operations
3. Routes for all modules
4. Index views for quick access
5. Create/edit/show views incrementally

The foundation is solid. Remaining work follows established patterns.
